# Numbering Systems

The intent of the DMX Demonstrator project is to teach theater technicians how the DMS protocols works.
Is it not intended to teach numbering systems such as binary, octal, hex, etc... As a result, the
 DMX Demonstrator project focuses on only 2 numbering systems:
- decimal - It is expacted everyone is familar with decimal, a.k.a base-10 math.
- binary - It is expacted everyone will gain a basic  familarity with binary, a.k.a, base-2 math.
- Conversion between these numbering system will be kept to a minimum.

As a result of this, you'll see the project pick on of these two systems for describing DMX.
The entire DMX stream will be approached as a series of binary values. Each bit within the DMX
stream will be refered to as a step which has a value of 0 or 1. When refering to a particular
point in the sequence, it will be  called by it's step number in decimal, e.g., step 42. With
very little excpetion, the binary representation of the step is not present in the system design.

A common collection of binary data in DMX is 8 bits used for dimmer values, start code, etc... 
While this is commonly called a byte and represented in hex, this will be presented as binary data
from 0-255 which maps 0-100%. This is the only conversion from binary to decimal. And while the hex
value 0xFF represents 255 and may be familar to theater technicians due to it's display on some (older)
lighting consoles, we'll avoid any inference between the two and let your favorite theory for this value
remain unchallenged.
