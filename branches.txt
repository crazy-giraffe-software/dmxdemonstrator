Rx shift goals
reset at frame reset
start counting when 0 is on data line
on the 9th clock pulse, load shifted + data bit if shifted highest bit is 0.
on the 11th clock pulse, data is valid if data bit + shifted lowest bits are 1
on the 11th clock pulse, reset. 

shift data available 40ns after clock pulses high
latch data on 1001
check stop bits on 1011
the problem with shift is I don't want the incoming data to impact the decision
so must check it on rising edge only, so before shift, or latch it and falling edge
So if 9, latch data into buffer. Orig used to drive this onto the bus feeding into secondary latches
So if 11, decide to latch the bus to secondary latches based on stop bits.
