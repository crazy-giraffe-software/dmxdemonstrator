# DMX Demonstrator Hardware

## Overview

The DMX Demonstrator hardware folder contains various transmitters, receivers, and modules which all for the control of brightness of 4 channels of dimming.

## Status

Each hardware folder will contain a readme explaining the details of the component and it's status. The following is a definition of some common status:

- ![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-verified-brightgreen)

The _verified_ badge indicates that the component has been built and tested for use with the DMX Demonstrator family and is safe to build.

- ![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-testing-yellow)

The _testing_ badge indicates that the component has completed the design and prototype phase and being verified for use with the DMX Demonstrator family. It usually is assigned to a component revision for which the previous version is _verified_.

- ![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-prototype-orange)

The _prototype_ badge indicates that the component has completed the design phase and is being built and tested for use with the DMX Demonstrator family.

- ![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-design-red)

The _design_ badge indicates that the component is still being design. has completed the design phase.

## Compatibility

For the components which connect to an Arduino, the readme provides a list of known compatible Arduino platforms. The DMX Demonstrator family will likely work with most Arduino boards, real or clones, but if you are having an
[issue](https://github.com/crazy-giraffe-software/dmxdemonstrator/issues) with a particular board, open an issue to ask for verification. Please provide as much detail on the board and where is was obtained as possible.

The following is a definition of some compatibilities:

- ![compat](https://img.shields.io/badge/compat-verified-brightgreen)

The _verified_ badge indicates that the component has been built and tested for the specific Arduino board.

- ![compat](https://img.shields.io/badge/compat-testing-yellow)

The _testing_ badge indicates that the component is being tested to determine if it is compatible with the specific Arduino board.

- ![compat](https://img.shields.io/badge/compat-research-orange)

The _research_ badge indicates that the component is being researched to determine if it is compatible with the specific Arduino board.

- ![compat](https://img.shields.io/badge/compat-incompatible-red)

The _incompatible_ badge indicates that the component is not compatible for the specific Arduino board.
