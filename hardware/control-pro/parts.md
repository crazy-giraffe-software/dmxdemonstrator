# Overview

The control pro is designed so that a series of components are sandwiched between 2 circuit boards. As a result, the heights of the
components are fairly sensitive in order to make things line up nicely. Here are the parts for which I designed.

## Slider Potentiometers

Getting a potentiometer and knob combo that would work with the rest of the components was probably the hardest part of part selection.
I had initially ordered some 60mm 10k sliders from SparkFun with matching knobs and they measures about 25mm from the bottom of the
part to the bottom of the knob, which is way too tall for the other components! I landed on a combination of Bourns PTA Series
sliders with an knob available from Sparkfun and others. During this process, I opted for a 45mm travel to keep the board smaller/cheaper
while still offering good mechanical resolution. The specific parts I designed for are:

- Dimmer Sliders: Bournes PTA4543-2015DPB103

  - [Sparkfun COM-09120](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9120)

## Toggle Switches

Just about any miniature toggle switch will do, many manufacturers make a switch in a similar size.
I specifically used the E-Switch Series 100 Miniature Toggle Switches, specifically:

- Clock Speed: E-Switch 100DP3T1B1M1QEH
  - [Datasheet](https://sten-eswitch-13110800-production.s3.amazonaws.com/system/asset/product_line/data_sheet/129/100.pdf)
  - [Digikey EG2413-ND](https://www.digikey.com/products/en?keywords=100DP3T1B1M1QEH)
  - [Mouser 612-100-H1111](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/E-Switch/100DP3T1B1M1QEH?qs=g8hxKYs5b3yy1L1GZVrx5w%3D%3D)
- Clock Step: E-Switch 100SP2T1B1M1QEH
  - [Datasheet](https://sten-eswitch-13110800-production.s3.amazonaws.com/system/asset/product_line/data_sheet/129/100.pdf)
  - [Digikey EG2373-ND](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/e-switch/100SP2T1B1M1QEH/EG2373-ND/378842)

## Rotary Potentiometer

With the toggle and sliders determining the basic component height, I searched for a rotary potentiometer to fit the requirements and once again
found a Bournes product. It has a 6mm "D"/flattened shaft so just about any 6mm flattened shaft knob will work but something with a set screw will
help secure it since only about 5mm or shaft protrudes through the top board. I did not find a great choice at Digikey, Mouser or Sparkfun but Amazon
and EBay has a ton of choices, designed for user with musical instruments. I even found one in purple to match the boards.
Specifically:

- Clock Speed Control: Bournes PTV09A-4025F-B103
  - [Datasheet](https://www.bourns.com/docs/Product-Datasheets/PTV09.pdf)
  - [Digikey PTV09A-4025F-B103-ND](https://www.digikey.com/products/en?keywords=PTV09A-4025F-B103)
  - [Mouser 652-PTV09A-4025FB103](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Bourns/PTV09A-4025F-B103?qs=okKRLHKnSlbwMbAO07mw0g%3D%3D)
- Knob:

## LEDs and Spacers

Luckily most LEDs have leads long enough to make it from the bottom to top board so nothing special is needed here, just make sure to have 17.5mm of lead length. Most LEDs have a voltage and current range near 2v and 10ma and the design will accommodate variances easily.
I like the [Sparkfun rainbow LED Kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12903) which gives you 2 each of 6 colors, letting you match colors for dimmers 1-4, data
and clock on both the transmitter and receiver without re-using colors. However, they will need a bit of added stability , which is where an LED spacer is needed.
Something between 16mm and 17mm will work fine. Here's a suitable one:

- LED: T 1 3/ or 5mm Led in various colors
  - [Sparkfun rainbow LED Kit](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12903)
- LED Spacer: WÃ¼rth 705820170
  - [Data sheet](https://www.we-online.de/katalog/datasheet/705820xxx_overview.pdf)
  - [Digikey 732-11617-ND](https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/w%C3%BCrth-elektronik/705820170/732-11617-ND/7681962)
  - [Mouser 710-705820170](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Wurth-Elektronik/705820170?qs=wr8lucFkNMUaK6Cwpwjx5Q%3D%3D)

## Cable and Connector

To connect the controller to the transmitter, you'll need a cable and connectors. Ribbon cable makes a nice choice for this and you can find pre-made ribbon cable
assemblies on Amazon and EBay easily. I've designed for a 16 pin cable. I recommend shrouded headers for connecting to PCBs and it ensures you don't plug the cable
in backwards. Here are some suitable headers:

- Header: 3M 30316-6002HB
  - [Datasheet](https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/1/78-5100-0818-4_D-221281.pdf)
  - [Digikey 3M11931-ND](https://www.digikey.com/products/en?keywords=30316-6002HB)
  - [Mouser 517-30316-6002](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/3M-Electronic-Solutions-Division/30316-6002HB?qs=QV10cN0MjFtE79zTqp0XZw%3D%3D)

## Standoff and Feet

Finally, you'll need some standoffs to hold the boards together and some feet to avoid the bottom PCB from dragging across the table. You can adjust the screw size and
add some washers or plexiglass if you like to create a smooth bottom surface. The standoffs should be 18mm in length and the boards are designed for an M3 screw.
Amazon and EBay offer tons of options. I even found [purple ones on EBay](https://www.ebay.com/itm/M3-Aluminum-Alloy-Female-Hex-Hexagon-Threaded-Bush-Sleeve-Standoff-Pillar-Spacer/174350100853?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&var=473550930125&_trksid=p2060353.m1438.l2649).
