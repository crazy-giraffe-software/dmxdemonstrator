## Questions/Answers

### Are you really going to build it as in actual hardware??

A: Yes. Two versions, one Arduino-based and one TTL-based.

### Are you really thinking of making kits available?

A: Maybe. Certainly the documentation will include sources for all parts someone can buy themselves. I can do kits but sales tax is a PITA so I'm thinking about skipping it.

### Scope displays: [I] just don’t remember what they looked like, I assume it consisted of a series of square waves, but how much of a channel’s data would simultaneously be displayed.

So anyway, if you folks have any scope photos, I’d be grateful and if not, you have one more expectant “customer” looking forward to the first working prototype

A: I'll include  scope displays in video and pic form.

### I thought at most there’d be a video

A: I'll create a series of videos for YouTube.

### As to your “big question”, I’m afraid I’ll have to ask for the pre-assembled version.

A: If I sell kits, I'll probably offer this version as well. I could partner with someone for the fabrication but this will lead to a surface-mount component design since it's easier to automate production this way.

### Will this be something that’s obvious like a USB port and will there be accompanying software?

A: Yes, accompanying software. I'm thinking to have it auto-detect the hardware after you plug it in and walk you through setup. As discussed, the custom software is really to optimize the display.

### For instance, will the transmit and receive modules be separate physical blocks connected by a cable?

I can imagine a setup where these would be placed on opposite sides of an instructor’s desk with the three-wire cable and maybe a monitoring laptop between whose screen would be made visible to the class on a large screen via projection as you suggest.

A: Yep, two separate boxes: transmitter and receiver. If using the display-pro, the signal is "intercepted" and displayed on two large-format LEDs.

### Would there be a way to remote the LED’s to make them more readable in a classroom situation, maybe with labels, etc.?

A: Let's have them light something else! Students can see the indirect effect of the dimmer levels.

### I agree that having them light something rather than just be just colored lights is much preferable but I’m not sure a model set is optimal.

Unless the model is huge the effect of light on those little figures is going to be hard to see from the fifth row and therewith maybe lose student interest.

The thought that occurs to me is how about a full size manakin head set in a shadow box maybe a 12” cube with 6” to 9” deep sides – that is from the rear of the cube - so everyone can see the figure. Then not only could you light from above, as I assume you’d do with the set model, but also the sides maybe with little returns to mask the light sources from the viewer and with each of these positions controlled by on-board switches. It would also give the instructor opportunity for a little levity like giving the head a name “Fred” comes to mind or “Fanny” depending on the gender of the manakin!

### The possibilities of lighting a human face with different colors and from different angles are attractive

Ugh #2. On rereading my preceding email, my suggestion that the manakin head be used to display the effect of lighting from various angles is pretty much a pipe dream since the LED strips would be the equivalent of flood lights on stage and therefore even if the top and side strips were switch selectable this would have little educational value so scratch that idea. I would still light from both top and both sides with the block angled so that this illumination would be visible.

A: What about a small spotlight instead of an LED strip?

I looked at the 12 v LED spot and I must say in the present setup I’m a little skeptical. This is to say that if we stick to the current proposed format of a “stage” approximately 12” square the throw distances, at least from the sides, would be so short that all one would see would be very intense concentrated spots of light on the subject though this would be somewhat ameliorated by the 120° beam spread. The spottiness would be aggravated it seems to me by the 6K color temperature… pretty aggressive though I assume that since these instruments are intended for artwork display the CRI must be pretty good.

As I think about it, it seems that these lamps might be made more useable with increased throw distances, in my mind’s eye maybe 6 or 7 inches rather than 1 or 2 that would be the case for our original design. I am thinking about enlarging our stage to maybe 18” wide while keeping the height at around 12”. Thus, the total package would be 18” x 12” by maybe 6” deep for our manakin head. Though a little bulky maybe not too bad with a carrying handle on top to get to and from the lecture hall. We’ll probably also need an “act curtain” in the form of a slide-in cover – ¼” ply or some such - both to protect the manakin and the instructor from questioning eyes as he/she carried the manakin to and from class! The stage would be in one hand and a lap-top in the other.

It seems we might be approaching something like the “trim level” options for the demonstrator itself, DMX and DMX – Pro, with the lesser option being back at our original 12” x 12” design and no attempt to demonstrate directional effects. The latter would be the simplest and could appropriately use the Styrofoam block. On the other hand, the directional demo would only be of use with the manakin head with its multitude of facets and angles.

All of this raises question in my mind of how this is going to be executed. I assume you guys don’t want to get into carpentry(!) so I assume what we would do would be to supply the electronics and then maybe provide some suggested plans for making the stage leaving it to the user to find a way to execute the construction (in an educational theatre environment maybe get the scene shop to do the actual fabrication). Thoughts?

A: My thoughts exactly. These are Theater people with access to a shop. Build any demo setup you like.

Yea, 5 positions sounds good though 8 dimmers instead of four sounds more difficult and more expensive and I should think maybe more crowded on the computer display? Seems we may be talking about a DMX Super Pro!  And of course, all of this directional stuff may stray too far from DMX for some uses. I can imagine, for instance, a manufacturer’s rep presenting DMX much as what happened 25 years ago when we got into all of this, and under these conditions the angled Styrofoam block illuminated by the LED strips might be all that’s needed.

A: K.I.S.S might be the way to go.

### How to construct the stage?

As to construction format of the stage, I’m thinking of the 1/4" ply to make it as light as possible connected with the simplest joinery such that even a marginal woodworker could cobble together in his/her basement. As I mentioned earlier, I no longer have a fully equipped shop, but I do have a skeletal facility which might actually help as a means of filtering out overly complicated construction. 

Another idea. Thinking about the person who hasn’t the ability or the time to undertake the woodwork, what do you think of engaging a contract shop to do the stage fabrication similar in concept to the kit versus assembled availabilities of the electronics? Going a step further maybe the stage could be offered fully assembled or in kit form. As I’m thinking about it, for someone who only has a skill saw an electric drill and a screwdriver, ripping the 3/4" x 3/4" strips I’m thinking of using for the corners would be tough for someone without a table saw. The kit alternative would be less expensive since it would require less labor and less shipping cost. 

### In any event all of this is to make a display that will be big enough to have impact at the fifth row.

A: Got it, needs to be big.

### but I totally agree that the visual output must light something even if it’s nothing more than a block of white Styrofoam and the strip LEDs seems the ideal way of doing this mounted as I said previously so that the strips themselves would be masked from sight by the students.

A: Agreed on the indirect format.

### Going a step further if the illuminated object, block of Styrofoam, manakin head or whatever, were beyond the receive module, from the viewer’s perspective there’d be information flow from left to right, i.e. from the lecturer’s right to left.

A: I think that makes sense. Like put the podium on one side with the laptop on it or the table, then the transmitter, then the receiver, then the dimmer display setup. The project display is center stage behind the equipment.

### In an ideal world the sliders would be made visible along with data on the computer screen

A: I can put virtual sliders in the custom software.

I think your notion of “virtual sliders” will do the job nicely. I can imagine the instructor beginning the presentation by moving the real live sliders to show that virtual sliders are tracking the movement of the “real” ones as the intensity of the RGB strips are varied. The sliders that the class can see are tracking the real thing.

A: Yep, even at slow DMX speeds, I think the virtual sliders are "real-time" even though the dimmer won't be due to the low clock speed.

### So where do we carry the DMX modules? … in storage compartments up left and up right in our stage the compartments and the rest of the “back-stage” being painted black of course.

A: I honestly had not thought that far. I can see putting all the DMX stuff in a pelican case w/ foam inserts. But then it's a pelican case, a laptop bag, and a mock stage/stage box. I think the notion of compartments in the stage box make sense. What if the "top" or "front" of the stage box is removable and has the DMX setup attached to it?
