# DMX Demonstrator DMX-512 IO Module (DMX-IO1)

![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-prototype-orange)

## Overview

The DMX-512 IO Module is a stand-alone module which generates or receives a DMX-512 signal,allowing the DMS Demonstrator system to communicate with DMX-512-compatible and RDM-compatible equipment. It can be used with a Receiver (DMX-RX2, DMX-RX?) to receive DMX-512. It can also be used with a Transmitter (DMX-TX2, DMX-TX?) to transmit the data stream to DMX-512.

## Online parts list

Sadly, Sparkfun does not offer all of the components required for DMX-512 IO Module. Additionally, Digikey does not carry Neutrik for connecting
to the DMX/RDM devices.

The parts can be purchased from [Mouser](https://www.mouser.com/) or [Newark](https://www.newark.com/). Links and part numbers are listed below.

### DMX Connectors

As you know, DMX commonly uses a 5-pin XLR connector. However, it is sometimes used with a 3-pin XLR connector which does not comply with the USITT spec. I'm not a fan of the 3-pin variant since it is the same as the audio connector making it seem as if DMX-512 and Mic cables can be used interchangeably, which they cannot reliably (your milage may vary).

That said, the DMX-IO1 supports both XLR-5 and XLR-3 connectors, one male and one female. You can choose between XLR-5 and XLR-3 but cannot use both at the same time. The design is made for Neutrik connectors (which is not a brand that Digikey carries). There are a few variation of the basic part numbers listed below with different shielding configurations. For instance, Newark only carries the NC3FAH-2, which works fine in place of the NC3FAH.

### Isolation

There are a few different DMX Arduino shields but many of them do not have isolation as recommended by the USITT spec. The DMX-DD1 shamelessly steals it's design from [SparkFun ESP32 Thing Plus DMX to LED Shield](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15110) which properly implements isolation including power supply isolation. Isolation is implemented using the following parts:

- U1, NMA0505SC:

[Mouser 782-6N137](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Vishay-Semiconductors/6N137/?qs=xCMk%252BIHWTZMrQz4FyDXhMg%3D%3D)
[6N137 Datasheet](https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/427/6n137-1767489.pdf)

You can use the DMX-IO1 without isolation by leaving out these parts and installing 5 solder bridges to bypass the isolation circuits:

- Under U1, you will find a pair of bypass pads for +5v
- Under U1, you will find a pair of bypass pads for GND
- Under U2, you will find a pair of bypass pads for RX
- Under U3, you will find a pair of bypass pads for DIR
- Under U4, you will find a pair of bypass pads for TX

## Version History
