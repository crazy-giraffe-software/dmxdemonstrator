# DMX Demonstrator Analog IO MOdule (DMX-IO2)

## Overview

The PWM IO Module is a stand-alone module which generates an analog signal where the voltage to the channels brightness. This module is for us with the Receiver IO Module (DMX-RX2) and other DMX Demonstrator components. The voltage of the analog signal is 0-10v by default but can be changed by adjusting the voltage regulator resistors.

## Parts

## Dimmer Options

The 0-10v output is a standard output voltage supported by a wide variety of dimmers. In the world of theatrical dimmers, two notable products that support 0-10v dimmer are:

- [Leviton DDS 5600](https://www.leviton.com/en/products/n5600)

  - 4 Channel, 600 Watt/Channel, 15 Amp Power Supply Cord Dimmer/Relay System. Micro-Plex And 0-10V Analog Is Standard, 120V. The DDS 5600 dimmer pack from Leviton provides a self-contained compact but powerful four channel dimmer/relay unit. DDS satellite dimmers are fully UL listed digital products that provide reliable, responsive performance with smooth, accurate dimming curves. Extensive epoxy encased toroidal filtering reduces the potential of dimmer generated noise. Individual channels are user assignable as dimmers or on/off relays for non-dim applications. All DDS Dimmers have built-in chase effects for stand-alone operation, perfect for all display type applications.

- [Dove Systems DimmerMaster Shoebox](http://www.dovesystems.com/shoebox)

  - The DimmerMaster Shoeboxes are a line of very compact and rugged truss-mount dimmers with a variety of power in and out options. They all accept DMX and 0-10V Analog inputs. They may be pipe or tree mounted and are perfect for tight spaces. The units accept both DMX-512 and 0 to +10VDC control signals.

The 0-10v standard is also used in a wide variety of commercial dimmers as well. Some notable products include:

- Mean Well LED Switching Power Supply - PWM Series
  - LED dimmers compatible with 0-10z dimming, Universal AC input range, Short circuit, over-load, over-voltage, and over-temperature protection, Waterproof IP67-rated
  - [24v Output](https://www.superbrightleds.com/moreinfo/constant-voltage-power-supplies/mean-well-led-power-supply-pwm-series-40-120w-24v-dimmable/3206/)
  - [12v Output](https://www.superbrightleds.com/moreinfo/constant-voltage-power-supplies/mean-well-led-power-supply-pwm-series-40-120w-12v-dimmable/3205/)
