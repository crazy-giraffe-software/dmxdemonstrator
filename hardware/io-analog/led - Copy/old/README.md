## Overview

The LED IO module can generate a 0 to +5v PWM signal where the duty cycle tracks the brightness of a channel. It can be used in conjunction with external LED drivers whose input only requires +5V for conttro. The Display-Pro is one such DMX-DSP
but you can find many more options are online electronics outlets such as SparkFun and Adafruit.
