# DMX Demonstrator Display-Pro (DMX-DSP)

## Overview

The display-pro is breakout board designed to intercept the 3-wire data/clock signal from the transmitter to amplify the data and clock signals and drive a larger display intended for a large audience.

It is built to drive an DC output for up to 60v volts so it is compatible with a variety of displays. The parts list has a display and power supply to keep you from having to come up with your own. Feel free to use the recommended option or play around with something else!

## Online parts list

Sparkfun offers all of the components required for the display-pro. You can find a parts lists [here](https://www.sparkfun.com/wish_lists/160583).

If you plan to use something else for the display, you can leave out the Big Dome Buttons, the 12v power supply (you'll likely need something to supply more current anyway), and the barrel jack (unless your power supply fits it). You may also want to consider adding heatsinks, either two of the [PRT-00121](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/121) or [PRT-14340](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14340) depending on your load.
