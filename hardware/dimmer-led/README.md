# DMX Demonstrator Receiver w/ 0-10v PWM Output (DMX-DA2)

## Overview

The leddimmer is an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) Shield board designed to accept the 3-wire data/clock signal from the transmitter and decode the data stream to control the output of 4 analog dimmer channels. These outputs can be used to drive a variety of customer dimmer options.

## Online parts list

The analog dimmer module is very similar to the the standard receiver, DMX-RX1. As a result, As a result, many of the components needed for the analog dimmer are included in the the receiver online parts list. You can find a parts lists [here](https://www.sparkfun.com/wish_lists/160541).

Additionally, you'll need some parts from the common parts lists as well. You can find the common parts list [here](https://www.sparkfun.com/wish_lists/160406).

Additional parts are required to complete the analog dimmer. See the Parts section below.

## Dimmer Options

The 0-10v output is a standard output voltage supported by a wide variety of dimmers. In the world of theatrical dimmers, two notable products that support 0-10v dimmer are:
- [Leviton DDS 5600](https://www.leviton.com/en/products/n5600)

  - 4 Channel, 600 Watt/Channel, 15 Amp Power Supply Cord Dimmer/Relay System. Micro-Plex And 0-10V Analog Is Standard, 120V. The DDS 5600 dimmer pack from Leviton provides a self-contained compact but powerful four channel dimmer/relay unit. DDS satellite dimmers are fully UL listed digital products that provide reliable, responsive performance with smooth, accurate dimming curves. Extensive epoxy encased toroidal filtering reduces the potential of dimmer generated noise. Individual channels are user assignable as dimmers or on/off relays for non-dim applications. All DDS Dimmers have built-in chase effects for stand-alone operation, perfect for all display type applications.

- [Dove Systems DimmerMaster Shoebox](http://www.dovesystems.com/shoebox)

  - The DimmerMaster Shoeboxes are a line of very compact and rugged truss-mount dimmers with a variety of power in and out options. They all accept DMX and 0-10V Analog inputs. They may be pipe or tree mounted and are perfect for tight spaces. The units accept both DMX-512 and 0 to +10VDC control signals.

The 0-10v standard is also used in a wide variety of commercial dimmers as well. Some notable products include:

- Mean Well LED Switching Power Supply - PWM Series
  - LED dimmers compatible with 0-10z dimming, Universal AC input range, Short circuit, over-load, over-voltage, and over-temperature protection, Waterproof IP67-rated
